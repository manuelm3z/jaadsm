Big O of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity(Best) | Time Complexity(Average) | Time Complexity(Worst) | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)                  | O(n2)                    | O(n2)                  | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)                  | O(n2)                    | O(n2)                  | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n2)                 | O(n2)                    | O(n2)                  | O(1)             |

## Conclusion
- Sorting is fundamental
- Bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent(not worth of learn)
- All have average time complexities that are quadractic
- We can do better... but we need more complex algorithms
