## Divide and Conquer

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can tremendously **decrease time complexity**

The advantage it's Log(N) complexity, this pattern it commonly use for sort big amounts of data.

[**Example**](example): Given a **sorted** array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found, return -1.
