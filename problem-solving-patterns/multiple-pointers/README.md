## Multiple Pointers

Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.

**Very** efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

**Example1**: Write a function called **sumZero** which accepts a **sorted** array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist

[**Example2**](example2): Implement a function called **countUniqueValues**, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.
